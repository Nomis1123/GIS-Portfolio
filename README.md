My GIS Portfolio: University Coursework Projects

This repository is a curated collection of my Geographic Information Systems (GIS) projects from university coursework. It features a variety of outputs, such as cartographic products, geospatial analysis reports, and immersive story maps, showcasing my capabilities in data acquisition, processing, visualization, and advanced spatial analysis.

About This Repository

This portfolio serves as a demonstration of my skills and practical application of GIS principles learned throughout my academic journey. Each project aims to address a specific geospatial problem or illustrate a particular GIS technique, ranging from fundamental mapping to complex spatial modeling and analysis.

You'll find examples of:

Static Cartographic Maps: High-quality maps designed for clarity, accuracy, and aesthetic appeal, often accompanied by map layouts and symbology files.

Geospatial Analysis Reports/Papers: Documents detailing methodologies, analytical processes, results, and conclusions of various spatial analyses. These often include embedded maps, charts, and tables.

Interactive Story Maps: Web-based narratives that combine maps with multimedia content (text, images, videos) to tell compelling stories about geographic topics.

Technologies & Software Used

The projects within this repository leverage a range of industry-standard and cutting-edge GIS software and platforms, including:

ArcGIS Pro: For advanced spatial analysis, 2D/3D mapping, and data management.

ERDAS Imagine: Utilized for remote sensing image processing, classification, and analysis.

QGIS: An open-source alternative for versatile mapping, data processing, and plugin development.

Google Earth Engine (GEE): For large-scale geospatial analysis, planetary-scale data processing, and cloud-based remote sensing.
